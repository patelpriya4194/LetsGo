Description of the project:
Nowadays people rely on technology primarily that includes the usage of mobile phone. A mobile phone is used for many tasks ranging from simple use like making calls to some important use like making payment; everything is digitized with the use of mobile application. Hence sensing the trend and requirement, this paper will introduce a social gathering application namely “Let’s Go”. The basic functionality of this application is that a user can create events to invite their friends and family members at one time. Being a location aware application, a user can search nearby restaurants, coffee shops, movies, shopping malls, night life, arts, beauty, spa, adventure etc. Once user selects the location (or gathering spot) a person can invite any people to that event through application. An invited friends who are using this application can accept the event request if interested or can decline if it does not suit their taste. Those people who are not using this application will receive a general text message as an event invitation. Moreover, based on user’s search habits this application can give recommendation on repetitive selected or search results. Finally, a user can turn on do-not-disturb switch to stay inactive if they are not interested to get notified about things happening into the application (basically events or chats).
